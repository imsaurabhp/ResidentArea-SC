You can create **Resident Areas, Buildings and Flats/Shops**.
You can create **members** for Resident Area Specific and create **governing bodies** too!
You can assign the members as **owners** while creating Flats/Shops.
You can create **proposals**(as President Only), vote on those proposals(as GoverningBody or Member Only) and process the proposals(as President Only) as well.
The proposals have the feature of a **deadline** so that they can stop the voting or keep it going based on the current time.
